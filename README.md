# EmuAttack
A game created using Java JPanel and Graphics. I made this for my AP Computer Science A final project. Similar to other Emu games such as [this game](https://github.com/grace04/emurun). Art and ideas from [this video by Oversimplified](https://youtu.be/BXpu6tbFCsI). Play the game by [clicking here](https://github.com/andrewma5/EmuAttack/releases/download/v1/EmuAttack.jar)!
